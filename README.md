Capstone Project Description â€“ Job Finder App (MERN Stack)

For my final capstone project, I developed a full-stack Job Finder web application using the MERN stack  MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The purpose of this app is to help users register an account, log in securely, and explore a list of job postings fetched from an external API.

The frontend is built using React and includes multiple routes for user registration, login, job searching, managing posts, and viewing saved jobs. I used React Router to manage page navigation and applied custom CSS styling to create a clean and user-friendly layout.

On the backend, I used Node.js with Express to set up a REST API. MongoDB is used as the database to store registered users. The app supports user registration and login functionality, with helpful console logs to track success or error responses. I also used Mongoose to manage the database schema and connections efficiently.

For job listings, I integrated the ArbeitNow public API, allowing users to search and filter job postings in real time. I used fetch() with async/await for smooth API communication and included error handling to manage failed requests or invalid user inputs.

This project demonstrates my understanding of full-stack development, including working with APIs, handling user authentication, managing frontend-backend connections, and using tools like dotenv for environment configuration. Overall, the project reflects my ability to build and deploy real-world applications using the MERN stack.
